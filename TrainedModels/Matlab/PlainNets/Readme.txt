The test error rate for CIFAR-100 for this 20-4 plain all-convolutional network with 4.5 million single-bit weights is 24.5%. Our 1-bit result for a ResNet shown in Table 1 in our submitted paper is 24.06%. 

We chose to provide code for the plain network as our first example, for the extra simplicity.
