This code was used for experiments accepted for publication in ICLR 2018 (iclr.cc). The ICLR version of the paper and the double-blind open peer review can be found at https://openreview.net/forum?id=rytNfI1AZ (download the PDF here: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rytNfI1AZ ) 

The paper is also on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08530

This page will be populated fully in coming days.

For now, we provide here code written in Matlab and using the matconvnet package (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) that will enable the reader to verify our strong error rate results using a single-bit for each weight in inference.
