This code was used for experiments published in ICLR 2018 (iclr.cc). The ICLR version of the paper and the double-blind open peer review can be found at https://openreview.net/forum?id=rytNfI1AZ (download the PDF here: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rytNfI1AZ ).

The paper is also on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08530

We provide in this repository code that will enable the reader to verify our strong error rate results using a single-bit for each weight in inference.

Versions include: 

1. tensorflow.keras (tensorflow 1.13, but also tested in tensorflow 2.1)
2. Matlab, using the matconvnet package (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) 
3. pytorch (coming)
